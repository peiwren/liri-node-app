# liri-node-app

## Intro
This Liri app is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives the users back data. It searches Spotify for songs, Bandsintown for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

## Four commands this liri app can take. And each command should do the following
1. node liri.js concert-this (artsit)

* If the user doesn't give a song name, by default, it will output data for the song, The Sign by Ace of Base.
